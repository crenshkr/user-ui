## Code Examples

_Code examples in markdowns are the best way to take notes_

### Inline code block

In javascript, if a function has no return value, it will automatically return `undefined`

### Multi-line code block

This is an example of a javascript function:

```
function myFunction() {
  return
}
```

This is an example of a javascript function with JS specific highlighting:

```js
function myFunction() {
  return;
}
```
